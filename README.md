Instructions for use (allowable actions): Morabaraba is traditional two-player strategy board game. 

Play consists of three stages:
Stage 1:

· Each player starts with 12 tokens called "cows".
·Starting with a clear board, each player alternatively places one cow at a time on a junction (circle). The aim is to create rows of three, either vertically, diagonally, or horizontally. Cows may only be placed on unoccupied junctions.
·When three-in-a-row is achieved, the player may remove (shoot) one of the opponent's cows. A player can not shoot an opponent's "three-in-a-row" cows if there are other cows on the board left to shoot.
·Only one of the opponent's cows may be shot at a time, even if two (or more) lines of three-in-a-row are achieved with one move.
·Once a cow is shot, it shall not be used in play again.

Stage 2 

·When all twelve cows of each player have been placed on the board, cows may be moved from one junction to another. A move consists of moving a cow from one junction to an unoccupied junction immediately linked and adjacent to that junction.

·Players may break their own lines of three-in-a-row in order to make new lines, or simply reposition their cows.
·Cows may be moved back and forth to the same two junctions repeatedly. A three-in-a-row may be made, broken and remade repeatedly.
·Each time a three-in-a-row is remade, an opponent's cow shall be shot.

stage 3
·When a player has lost all but three cows, then a player may move a cow to any vacant junction on the board with each move.

 

Winning the game
·The game is won when the opponent cannot move any cows: or when the opponent has lost all but two cows.
·When a player is down to three cows, and neither player is able to shoot an opponent's cow within ten moves, the game is a draw.

Tools used: ThinkLib library

Concepts used: Lists and arrays, custom classes and objects ( turtle to draw the board and other classes), enums, strings(and string methods). iterations(for loops and foreach loop),event handling, algorithm ( to move the cows around making sure every cow moves according to order, I/O files to write the instructions of the game.

Assumptions: minimun screen resolution of 800x600

Limitations: [State ANY limitations concerning what your program cannot do, though those functions may be implied by the nature of the project]
